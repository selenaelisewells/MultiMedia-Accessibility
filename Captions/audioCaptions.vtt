00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
I can't stop this feeling

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Deep inside of me

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Girl, you just don't realize

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
What you do to me

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
When you hold me

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
In your arms so tight

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
You let me know

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Everything's all right

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
I'm hooked on a feeling

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
I'm high on believing

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
That you're in love with me

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Lips as sweet as candy

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Its taste is on my mind

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Girl, you got me thirsty

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
For another cup o' wine

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
Got a bug from you girl

01:15.000 --> 01:13.000
But I don't need no cure

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
I'll just stay a victim

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
If I can for sure

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
All the good love

01:24.500 --> 01:26.000
When we're all alone

01:26.500 --> 01:27.000
Keep it up girl
